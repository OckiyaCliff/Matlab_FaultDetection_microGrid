% Load and preprocess data
% Replace with your actual data loading and preprocessing code

% Split data into training and testing sets
% Replace with your data splitting logic

% Create and configure the neural network
net = feedforwardnet([hidden_layer_sizes]);
net.trainFcn = 'trainlm';  % Choose the appropriate training function
net.trainParam.goal = 1e-5; % Set training goal

% Train the neural network
net = train(net, training_inputs, training_targets);

% Test the neural network
testing_outputs = sim(net, testing_inputs);

% Perform fault detection, location, and classification
for sample_idx = 1:size(testing_outputs, 2)
    predicted_output = testing_outputs(:, sample_idx);
    
    % Implement fault detection, location, and classification logic
    % Analyze predicted_output to determine if a fault occurred
    % If a fault occurred, determine its location and type
end

% Display results
% Implement code to display the results of fault detection, location, and classification
